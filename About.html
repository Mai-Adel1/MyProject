            <article><div class="p1"><p >Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
               Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients,
               such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
               The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
               energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding 
               behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific
                ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.</p></div></article>
                <h2>Food sources:</h2>
                <div class="p1"><p >Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants;
                   but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants.
                    Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.
                    Corn (maize), wheat, and rice – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide.
                    Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.
                  Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi, 
                  especially mushrooms. Fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented
                   and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina.
                  Inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient.</p></div>
